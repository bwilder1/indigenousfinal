      <h1>Firsting & Lasting</h1>

      <br/>
      <br/>

      <h3>What It Is</h3>
      <p>
        Firsting & Lasting is a concept created by Jean M. O'Brien in her book <span style="font-style: italic;">Firsting and Lasting</span>. It was created to show how colonizers came to America 
        and created their own history by considering themselves to be the first people in there. Lasting then shows that 
        Native Americans are slowly being assimilated into western culture, deeming the last full blooded Native American
        as extinct, meaning there are no "real" Native Americans left. 
      </p>

      <h3>Town</h3>
      <p>
        Osage Beach was established in 1886 in Missouri. In 1931, the Bagnell Dam was completed which lead to the creation of 
        the Lake of the Ozarks. By 1959 the town was incorporated and there are around 4,900 residents living there today. The town 
        is named after the Osage Tribe which had members that resided in that area before settlers came. Currently, over 90% of the 
        population is white, and under 1% (0.84%) are Native American.

      <h3>School of the Osage</h3>
      <p>
        The School of the Osage consists of schools ranging from Pre-K level to high school. The home page of their 
        website says "School of the Osage: Home of the Indians", yet it's hard to understand exactly why it's the home 
        of the Indians, given only 
        <a id="a1" href="https://www.usnews.com/education/best-high-schools/missouri/districts/school-of-the-osage/osage-high-school-11896#:~:text=Overview%20of%20Osage%20High%20School&text=The%20AP%C2%AE%20participation%20rate,of%20students%20are%20economically%20disadvantaged." target="_blank">0.3%</a> 
        of the school is Native American and 
        <a id="a1" href="https://www.usnews.com/education/best-high-schools/missouri/districts/school-of-the-osage/osage-high-school-11896#:~:text=Overview%20of%20Osage%20High%20School&text=The%20AP%C2%AE%20participation%20rate,of%20students%20are%20economically%20disadvantaged." target="_blank">86.8%</a> 
        are white. Playing into the role of Firsting and Lasting, Osage high school is using the "Indian" to claim rights over the land, 
        making it seem like this WAS the home to Native Americans and that there are no more left. Throughout the website there are kids wearing shirts with slogans saying "roll tribe roll" 
        and "Indians". The ignorance of this is extremely dangerous in an educational setting, as kids will eventually view Native Americans as a historic population rather than 
        one that continues to fight against injustices.

      <h3>School Logo</h3> <!-- ADD PICTURE OF LOGO-->
      <p>
        The logo for the School of the Osage is a classic settler interpretation of the head of a Native American. 
        Although it doesn't have too much detail, the headdress full of feathers is a stereotypical depiction of Native Americans. 
        Previously in their gym, they had an undeniably racist image depicting Native Americans plastered on the walls (see article below). 
        The use of this imagery in contradiction to them being the "Home of the Indians", goes to show their everlasting relationship 
        with Firsting and Lasting.
