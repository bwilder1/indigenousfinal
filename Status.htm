      <h1>Current Status of The Osage</h1>

      <br/>
      <br/>

      <h3>Government</h3>
      <p>
        Beginning in June 2006, the Osage Tribal Council transitioned into a constitutional government. They now 
        have executive, legislative, and judicial branches. One aspect of their government that directly supports tribal sovereignty 
        is the allowance of Self-Governance. Self-Governance allows the Osage Tribe to have full control and decision making power 
        over federal financial resources. The Osage Tribe can then allocate those resources to address different priorities 
        within the tribe. 
      </p>

      <br/>

      <h3>Tribal Chief</h3>
      <p>
        <img id="dalog" src="SB.jpg" alt="Chief Standing Bear" title="Chief Standing Bear"/> The current chief of the Osage Nation is Chief Geoffrey Standing Bear, who has been in this position since 2014. 
        He is also the great-grandson of Chief Fred Lookout, the longest Osage Chief, lasting 28 years. Chief Standing Bear 
        has many terrific accomplishments, like practicing federal Indian law for 34 years, being a member of the Osage Congress 
        for four years, and even being named Oklahoman of the Year in 2017. His goal is to expand and protect the Osage Nation, 
        and that can only be done "through the power of the Osage child."
      </p>

      <br/>

      <h3>Population</h3>
      
      <p>
        Today, there are roughly 25,000 members of the Osage Nation, with around 4,500 living on the Osage Nation Reservation 
        in Oklahoma. The rest are mostly spread out across Missouri, Arkansas, and Kansas; however, finding exact numbers has been 
        difficult due to the lack of reports. It's important to note that many demographic reports include Native Americans as a footnote, 
        making it seem as though they are deemed irrelevant or even extinct within western society.
      </p>

      <br/>

      <h3>Initiatives Taken</h3>
      <p id="lnk">You can find links to these initiatives under the "Sources" page.</p>
      <p>
        <span style="font-weight: bold; font-size: 15px;">Real Estate Developments:</span> The Osage Nation is looking to 
        create a new hotel and casino at the Lake of the Ozarks, which neighbors Osage Beach. The Osage Nation has seen 
        tremendous support from Missouri state and local officials, along with stakeholders. Not only is this economically 
        beneficial for the Osage Nation, but for the Missouri community too, as the Osage are looking to give back to local communities 
        through philanthropy. They plan to make financial contributions to local schools, law enforcement and other first responders, local charities, and 
        community improvement projects.
      </p>
      <p>
        <span style="font-weight: bold; font-size: 15px;">Land Restoration:</span> The Osage Nation has been given federal funding 
        to address abandoned wells within the Osage Nation Reservation. These wells were placed there as a result of settler mineral 
        extraction. The drilling equipment creates hazards for natural resources, animals, and vehicles such as tractors. 
        Unplugged wells can also have methane gas leaks that will pollute the air and cause health issues for both animals and humans.
        The Osage Nation will use these funds to locate the wells and complete any necessary actions to help restore the land around them.
      </p>
      <p>
        <span style="font-weight: bold; font-size: 15px;">Technological Advancements:</span> The Osage Nation was granted 
        $40.6 million to build out a high-speed fiber optic broadband through the reservation. The internet is a very important 
        public necessity that needs to be affordable and accessible to everyone across the country. Indigenous communities have 
        historically been overlooked when considering communities that are struggling, making this a large step forward to 
        equality for Indigenous communities like the Osage.
