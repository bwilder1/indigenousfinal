    <h1>About The Osage Tribe</h1>

    <br/>
    <br/>

    <h3>Origin</h3>
    <h4>Ni-u-kon-ska (People of the Middle Waters)</h4>
    <p>
      The Osage are a Dhegiha Siouan speaking tribe, along with the Omaha, Ponca, Kaw and Quapaw. Around the time 
      of A.D. 1000, the Dhegiha Siouan Tribes migrated to Cahokia, an Indigenous city which was directly across the Mississipi River from 
      St. Louis. By A.D. 1250, the Omaha, Ponca, Kaw and Quapaw tribes departed, leaving the remaining tribe, the Osage, in the Cahokia/St. Louis 
      area. In A.D. 1300, the Osage continued moving westward to relocate within the central and western portions of Missouri. 
      At the start of colonialism, the Osage Tribe had been living comfortably along the Osage and Missouri rivers for hundreds of years, 
      unaware of injustices they would be subject to at the hands of settler colonialism.
    </p>

    <br/>
    <h3>Religion</h3>
    <p>
      The historic religion of the Osage was pantheistic. They believed in a higher up force called Wa-kon-tah. 
      They believed that the history of the universe along with all current and future changes come at the hands of Wa-kon-tah. 
      The Osage, however, claimed they never fully understood this force and how it worked, saying that people were able 
      to communicate with spirits through visions. The introduction of colonialism led to a massive increase in Christianity, which 
      the Osage took part in through the form of the Peyote Religion, introduced in 1890. The Peyote Religion was short-lived due 
      to the influx in assimilation into western Christian culture. Few Osage Peyote churches remain, and those that do 
      are affiliated with the Native American Church.

    <h3>Culture</h3>
    <p>
      <span style="font-weight: bold; font-size: 15px;">Hunting:</span> The Osage relied partly on hunting 
      to provide food for their tribe. They would hunt wild game animals such as elk, bison, and deer. There
      were two bison hunts a year, one happening in the summer and the other in the fall. The purpose of the 
      summer hunt was to obtain meat and fat. The goal of the fall hunt was to provide food and clothing for the coming winter. 
      The Osage used bison hide to create coats, moccasins, leggings and other forms of clothing.
    </p>
    <p>
      <span style="font-weight: bold; font-size: 15px;">Dance:</span> Dancing is a way in which the Osage can 
      continue to make spiritual connections with their tribe. The In-Lon-Schka is a ceremonial gathering of the Osage 
      that involves singing, drumming, and dancing. It is considered to be one of the most important gatherings for the Osage 
      which allows them to celebrate and pass on Osage culture.
    </p>
    <p>
      <span style="font-weight: bold; font-size: 15px;">Clothing:</span> Men and women historically wore 
      clothing made from treated animal hide, usually being bison, buffalo, or deer. During In-Lon-Schka, men would wear, 
      along with other clothing, a roach. A roach is a headpiece for men made with deer hair, porcupine hair, and an eagle 
      feather. Women would wear shawls or blankets over their clothing that pertained to the ceremony.
