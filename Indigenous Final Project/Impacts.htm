      <h1>Impacts of Settler Colonialism</h1>

      <h3>Structural Impacts</h3>
      <p>
        <span style="font-weight: bold; font-size: 15px;">Institutional Racism:</span> The Osage within Oklahoma found that their land was rich with crude oil. 
        Upon this finding, the Osage negotiated mineral rights for just compensation, leaving some tribal members as the richest people 
        on earth for a little while. The federal government quickly implemented a system of guardianship for the Osage Tribe, deeming 
        any member without any white ancestry as "incompetent". This allowed for settlers to act as a financial manager for Osage members 
        until they could prove they were "competent" enough to manage their money. Through legally deeming them as incompetent, white settlers 
        were able to essentially rob members of the Osage tribe. 
      </p>
      <p>
        <span style="font-weight: bold; font-size: 15px;">Sovereignty:</span> Sovereignty is a concept that is crucial for the flourishment of Indigenous communities through the act of self determination.
        The sovereignty of the Osage Tribe has been repeatedly threatened through the implementation of policies/laws that look 
        to solely benefit settlers. The introduction of reservations, specifically the Kansas Reservation, was a way for the federal 
        government to further disposses the Osage Tribe. The Kansas Reservation restricted Osage access to other historic territories, 
        limited their ability for self-governance, and inadequately allowed for the management of cultural practices.

      <h3>Historical Impacts</h3>
      <p>
        <span style="font-weight: bold; font-size: 15px;">Forced Relocation:</span> Missouri gained statehood in 1821, just 18 years after the 
        Louisiana Purchase. Soon after the declaration of statehood, over 5,000 Osage members were removed from their land
        and forced to reside in "Indian Terrotiry" which is known known as Oklahoma. After the city of Kansas was established 
        in 1854, the Osage were relocated into a reservation within the city leaving them with heavily restricted land access.
        <p>
          <span style="font-weight: bold; font-size: 15px;">Broken Treaties:</span> The violation of treaties has been a historic 
          action that settlers have taken to further disposses and ultimately remove Indigenous communities from America. 
          The Treaty of Fort Clark (1808), also known as the Treaty of Fort Osage, established a boundary between Osage land
          and land available for settlers. This treaty was quickly broken, as settlers continued to encroach on Osage territory 
          and later claim it as their own. The Treaty of 1839 forced the Osage to relocate to a reservation in Kansas, in return 
          for regular payments, security, and protection of sovereignty. A combination of inadequate payments and continued 
          settler enroachment led to this treaty ultimately being broken.

        </p>
        <p>
          <span style="font-weight: bold; font-size: 15px;">Forced Assimilation:</span> Although there are many examples of 
          forced assimilation for the Osage Tribe, one that had a big impact on the Osage was the introduction of Christianity.
          Many missionaries came to southeast Kansas to convert the Osage to Christianity through baptisms. The increase in Christianity 
          lead to the emergence of Christian boarding schools. In 1869, President Grant allowed for all US Indian agencies to be 
          under Christian control. Churches were given massive amounts of power over tribal affairs, leading to the "civilization" 
          of Indigenous Peoples.
