      <h3>Summary</h3>
      <p>
        <!--
          Hello everyone and welcome to my website! My name is Ben Wilder, and I am a student at Babson College who recently completed a course on Indigenous Peoples' politics and history. 
          As a final project, I have been tasked with creating a website to further educate people on the Osage Tribe, with a highlight on their presence in Missouri. 
          Throughout the website, you can learn about the Osage Tribe and the effects that settler colonialism has had on them. 
          I want to make it clear that this website is not affiliated with the Osage Tribe; it is simply a way for me to express my learning through the form of a website.

        Hello everyone, and welcome to my website! My name is Ben Wilder, and I am a student at Babson College who 
        recently completed a course on Indigenous Peoples politics and history. As a final project, I have been 
        tasked with creating a website to further educate people on the Osage Tribe, with a highlight on their presence in Missouri. Throughout the website, 
        you can learn about the Osage Tribe and the effects that settler colonialism has had on them. I want to make it clear 
        that this website is <span style="font-weight: bold; font-size: 15px;">not affiliated</span> with the Osage Tribe;

      <h3>Goal</h3>
      <p>
        The goal of my website is to educate people who are curious about the Osage Tribe in general. I wanted to 
        highlight their presence in Missouri, specifically in Osage Beach, because that has been a place I have been going to for a while. I hope 
        to use my education on the subject as a way to inspire people to support Indigenous communities that are 
        local to their area. Many of us have benefited from a system that historically and presently marginalizes Indigenous Peoples.
        It is on us to use our education to take action that results in direct support for Indigenous communities.
